Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install Apache HTTP Server on Ubuntu in AWS console:

Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance
- Sign in to your AWS Management Console.
- Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click on "Launch Instance" to launch a new EC2 instance.
- Select an Ubuntu Server AMI of your choice and proceed with the configuration and launch process.
- Choose the desired instance type, configure security groups, and follow the prompts to create the instance. Make sure to allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) in the security group.

Step 2: Connect to the Instance
- Once the instance is launched, select the instance in the EC2 dashboard and click on "Connect" to get the connection details.
- Follow the instructions to connect to your EC2 instance using SSH. You can use tools like PuTTY (for Windows) or Terminal (for macOS/Linux).

Step 3: Update System Packages
- Once you are connected to your EC2 instance, update the package lists and upgrade existing packages by running the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Step 4: Install Apache Server
- To install Apache, run the following command:
```
sudo apt install apache2
```
- During the installation process, you may be prompted to confirm the installation. Type "Y" and press Enter to proceed.

Step 5: Start Apache Service
- After the installation is complete, Apache should start automatically. You can verify the status of the Apache service by running:
```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
- If the service is not running, start it manually using the following command:
```
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

Step 6: Access Apache Default Page
- Open a web browser and enter the public IP address or public DNS of your EC2 instance. You should see the default Apache welcome page, confirming that the installation was successful.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Apache HTTP Server on your Ubuntu instance in AWS console. You can now configure Apache to serve your website or web application as needed.
